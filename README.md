# Linux
The base OpenFrameworks CMake project was based on
https://github.com/PPilmeyer/OF-Template-for-CLION

To compile on Linux, clone the source and navigate to the linux project folder.
There, run the "setup.sh" script. You will get some password inputs for dependency installations.
After it has completeted, open it in your IDE of choice or use CMake to compile it.
